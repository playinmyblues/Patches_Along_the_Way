# Patches_Along_the_Way
This repository is something I started while working through a book on Pure Data called "Pure Data programming fundamentals: Patching, effects, sound synthesis," by Marizio Di Berardino. As recommended with all pretty much all teaching of coding and this book is no different, it is recommended that you explore the concepts and material on your own. So I did. And this repository started out because I developed a simple patch that is a basic sequencer. The patch had started as a basic 3-step sequencer from the book, even if it was not really described that way. Then the idea of adding more steps and then a semitone select to add easier variation came along. The two sides happened before that and so did the staggering of the sides soon after I saw the two [Toggle] objects near each other.

As I was playing around with the timing of the two sides and staggering them, some interesting melodies and combinations were happening.

Hopefully, I will develop some interesting libraries along the way.
